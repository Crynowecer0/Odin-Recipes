  <img src="../images/marsala.webp" alt="">
  <!-- Paragraph description -->
  <p>A sweet and savory mushroom, butter, and wine based sauce served over lightly breaded chicken cutlets</p>
  <!-- Ingredients as a UL -->
  <ul>
    <b>Ingredients</b>
    <li>1 1/4 cups (300ml) Marsala wine (see note)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (180ml) homemade chicken stock or low-sodium store-bought broth</li>
    <li>1 packet unflavored gelatin, such as Knox (2 1/2 teaspoons; 10g)</li>
    <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken cutlets, each pounded about 1/2 to 1/4 inch thick (1 3/4 pounds; 780g total)</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>About 1 cup all-purpose flour (5 ounces; 140g), for dredging</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed</li>
    <li>10 ounces (280g) cremini mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 medium shallots (6 ounces; 165g), minced</li>
    <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon (about 3g) minced fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons (45g) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce</li>
    <li>White wine vinegar, sherry vinegar, or fresh lemon juice, to taste</li>
    <li>Minced fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Steps as an OL -->
  <ol><b>Directions</b>
    <li>Combine Marsala and stock in a mixing bowl or large measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin all over surface. Set
      aside.</li>
    <li>Season chicken cutlets all over with salt and pepper. Pour a roughly 1/2-inch layer of flour into a wide,
      shallow bowl. Dredge each cutlet in flour, tap off excess, and transfer to clean plate.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches if necessary, add
      chicken and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Using a slotted spatula,
      transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
    <li>Add mushrooms to skillet (do not drain remaining oil) and cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms have
      released their juices and browned well, about 10 minutes. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring,
      until shallots are translucent, about 2 minutes. Add more oil if pan seems too dry at any point.</li>
    <li>Pour Marsala mixture into pan, making sure to scrape in all the gelatin. Bring to a boil, whisking and scraping
      up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until liquids are reduced by about three-quarters. Add butter and soy
      sauce and whisk constantly until emulsified and sauce takes on the consistency of heavy cream. Season with salt
      and pepper. Taste sauce and adjust with a small amount of vinegar or lemon juice, as needed.</li>
    <li>Return chicken cutlets to pan, swirling to bathe them in the sauce and warm them through. If the sauce begins to
      break at any point, swirl in a splash of water to bring it back together. Transfer to a warmed serving plate,
      spooning sauce all over chicken. Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
